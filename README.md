# Lisp-It

Small project where I write from scratch a small variant of the Lisp programming language in C. But before that check this/these branches:

## Warm Up

In the *warm-up* branch the following topics are tackled:

1. What is a compiler and what are the compilation steps.
2. Built-in data types.
3. Type struct.
4. The *main*
5. Pointers
6. Portability
7. Natural Languages
8. Parser & Parsing & Grammar
