# Lisp-It

Small project where I write from scratch a small variant of the Lisp programming language in C. But before that check this/these branches:

## Warm Up

Just to get (re)acquantained with the C programming language. Before, in fact, jumping straight into writing Parsers and other
fancy stuff, We should know:

1. What is a compiler and its process (linking, etc)
2. Built-in data types.
3. How to define your own data types.
4. What is the main and its arguments.
5. Know the existence of pointers (used in strings and lists)
6. How to handle "PORTABILITY" in C (as it is not a standard feature like it is for Java)
